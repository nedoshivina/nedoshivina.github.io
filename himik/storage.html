  <h1 align="center">Occupational safety requirements during storage of chemical reagents </h1>
  <ol>
  	<li>When choosing a place and conditions for storage and use of each physical and chemical properties of a reagent, take into account the explosion hazard. </li>
  	<li>In order to prevent fires and explosions in laboratories and warehouses for chemical reagents, it is possible to store chemicals together only according to their compatibility groups (Appendix).</li>
  	<li>Chemical reagents should be stored in tightly closed jars or other vessels with labels affixed to them, on which the exact name of the substance and its characteristics must be indicated. If the label is lost, and it is not possible to identify the content, the latter must be destroyed in accordance with the established procedure.</li>
  	<li>Each laboratory should have a list of stored chemicals. A separate list of toxic substances, the rules for their storage should be drawn up and a person responsible for storage, issuance and accounting of poisons should be appointed. </li>
  	<li>Concentrated acids (sulfuric, hydrochloric, nitric, etc.) should be stored under draft or in specially equipped ventilated cabinets on porcelain trays in thick-walled dishes with a capacity of no more than 2 liters. When storing these acids, it is necessary to take measures to prevent their contact with organic substances. </li>
  	<li>Chemical reagents exposed to light should be stored in dark glass bottles or wrapped in black paper in dark rooms. </li>
  	<li>Strong oxidants (magnesium chlorate, hydrogen peroxide, etc.) should be kept isolated from other chemicals and reagents. </li>
  	<li>Alkali metals in a fire-walled, carefully sealed container. Flasks with alkali metals must be placed in metal boxes with tight-fitting lids, the walls and bottom of which are lined with asbestos. </li>
  	<li>In laboratories, store mercury in a fume hood in an unbearable dish or thick-walled glassware with ground-in stoppers (on a vacuum putty), installed in a shock-absorbing case on metal pallets. In small quantities (20-30 ml), mercury can be stored in sealed glass ampoules in laboratory cabinets. In this case, the ampoules should be enclosed in tight cases (plastic or metal) to prevent the spill of mercury in case of accidental ampoule breakage. </li>
  	<li>The stock of flammable and combustible liquids should not exceed the daily requirement. Flammable liquids and combustible liquids should be stored in laboratory rooms in thick-walled glassware, closed with corks, placed in special metal boxes with lids, the walls and bottom of which should be lined with asbestos. Containers with flammable liquids stored in the laboratory should not exceed 1 liter. It is forbidden to store liquids with a boiling point below 50 Â° C (pentane, carbon disulfide, diethyl ether, etc.) directly in boxes for flammable liquids. </li>
  	<li>Liquids poured into glass containers under a cork have great destructive power, therefore, a container with a reagent should have a free volume of approximately 10% of its capacity. </li>
  	<li>Store toxic chemicals in lockers in strict accordance with special rules and instructions for their storage. </li>
  	<li>In the premises where chemical reagents are stored, fire extinguishing means should be available: asbestos blankets, fire extinguishers, stored without access to air, in each separate boxes with dry sand in the stored working area. </li>
  	<li>It is prohibited: - joint storage of substances of one group with substances of another group; storage of reagents in containers without labels, or with inscriptions made in pencil on glass; storage of chemical reagents in a faulty container and without plugs; </li>
