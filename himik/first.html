  <ol>
    <li>In case of thermal burns of the skin (except for organic burns of the 1st degree), call a doctor or immediately deliver the victim to the nearest medical institution. Before providing medical care, it is necessary to carefully, avoiding injury, expose the burned area and close it with a dry antiseptic bandage. The adhered remains of burnt clothing must not be removed from the burned area and it must not be cleaned in any way. Any available pain relievers should be used to relieve pain: amidopyrine (0.5 g). analgin (0.5- g), aspirin (0.5-1 g), diphenhydramine (0.1 g), suprastin (0.025 g), etc., cooling over the bandage (ice, snow, cold water in 18 vial or plastic bag). In case of 2nd and 3rd degree burns, do not moisten the burned areas with cold water. </li>
    <li>In the event of an electric shock, first of all, it is necessary to turn off the switch. It is forbidden to touch the exposed parts of the victim's body with bare hands until the power is turned off. If the victim has lost consciousness, the pulse and breathing should be checked first. If there is a pulse and breathing, it is necessary to lay the victim on his back and turn his head to the side in order to prevent the music from falling, sprinkle with cold water and let the band sniff. After increasing consciousness, give valeriaiki (15-20 drops) and hot tea to drink. If breathing and bullet are absent or weak and uneven, start artificial respiration "mouth-to-mouth" with simultaneous heart massage. If there are burns on the victim's body, first aid should be provided in the same way as for thermal burns (see item 1). In case of electric shock that caused at least a short-term loss of consciousness, regardless of the state of health and successful first aid, you must immediately call a doctor. </li>
    <li>In case of poisoning, remove the victim from the zone of poisoning to fresh air and call a doctor. Immediately wash the stomach or give emetics and adsorbents (activated charcoal). In case of poisoning with phosphorus compounds, milk should not be given. In case of contact with skin, wash it off thoroughly with warm water and soap. Try to remove hydrophobic compounds from the skin with a dry cloth. Wash off with alcohol only if other methods do not help, since alcohol promotes absorption of the poison through the skin. </li>
    <li>In case of chemical burns of the skin, rinse the affected area with a stream of water for at least 15 minutes. For burns with acids and acid-like substances, apply lotions with a 2% solution of soda, and for burns with alkalis, a 296 solution of acetic or citric acid. If bromine comes into contact with the skin, wash it off with plenty of alcohol and lubricate the affected area with burn ointment. </li>
    <li>In case of cuts (capillary or venous bleeding) apply a bandage to the cancer. Rinse the wound only if poisonous substances get into it; in other cases, it is forbidden to rinse the wound with water and medicines. Arterial bleeding is stopped by applying a harness or completely bending the limb in the joint and fixing it in this position with a belt, bandage or rubber hose. Wastes no time. Bleeding can cause death within 3-5 minutes. If the tourniquet cannot be applied immediately, in order to temporarily stop the bleeding, it is necessary to press with fingers on the vessel above the wound. The maximum time, not which you can not remove the horror, in the warm season is 1.5-2 hours, in the cold season -1 hour. </li>
    <li>In case of minor cuts in the hands and other parts of the body, small fragments must be removed from the wound with glass, then rinsed with a 2% solution of potassium permanganate or ethyl alcohol, lubricated with iodine tincture and bandaged.</li>
