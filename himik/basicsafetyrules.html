  <h1 align="center">Basic Safety Rules</h1>
  <p>Basic safety rules for laboratory conduct should be observed whenever working in a laboratory. Many of the most common safety rules are listed below.</p> 
  <ol>
  <li>Know locations of laboratory safety showers, eyewashstations, and fire extinguishers. The safety equipment may be located in the hallway near the laboratory entrance.</li>
  <li>Know emergency exit routes.</li>
  <li>Avoid skin and eye contact with all chemicals.</li>
  <li>Minimize all chemical exposures.</li>
  <li>No horseplay will be tolerated.</li>
  <li>Assume that all chemicals of unknown toxicity are highly toxic.</li>
  <li>Post warning signs when unusual hazards, hazardous materials, hazardous equipment, or other special conditions are present.</li>
  <li>Avoid distracting or startling persons working in the laboratory.</li>
  <li>Use equipment only for its designated purpose.</li>
  <li>Combine reagents in their appropriate order, such as adding acid to water.</li>
  <li>Avoid adding solids to hot liquids.</li>
  <li>All laboratory personnel should place emphasis on safety and chemical hygiene at all times.</li>
  <li>Never leave containersof chemicals open.</li>
  <li>All containersmust have appropriate labels. Unlabeled chemicals should never be used.</li>
  <li>Do not taste or intentionally sniff chemicals.</li>
  <li>Never consume and/or store food or beverages or apply cosmetics in areas where hazardous chemicalsare used or stored.</li>
  <li>Do not use mouth suction for pipetting or starting a siphon.</li>
  <li>Wash exposed areas of the skin prior to leaving the laboratory.</li>
  <li>Long hair and loose clothing must be pulled back and secured from entanglement or potential capture.</li>
  <li>No contact lenses should be worn around hazardous chemicals – even when wearing safety glasses.</li>
  <li>Laboratory safety glasses or goggles should be worn in any area where chemicals are used or stored. They should also be worn any time there is a chance of splashes or particulates to enter the eye. Closed toe shoes will be worn at all times in the laboratory. Perforated shoes or sandals are not appropriate.</li>
  <li>Determine the potential hazards and appropriate safety precautions before beginning any work.</li>
  <li>Procedures should be developed that minimize the formation and dispersion of aerosols.</li>
  <li>If an unknown chemical is produced in the laboratory, the material should be considered hazardous.</li>
  <li>Do not pour chemicals down drains. Do NOT utilize the sewer for chemical waste disposal.</li>
  <li>Keep all sink traps (including cup sink traps and floor drains) filled with water by running water down the drain at least monthly.</li>
  <li>Do not utilize fume hoods for evaporations and disposal of volatile solvents.</li>
  <li>Perform work with hazardous chemicalsin a properly working fume hoodto reduce potential exposures.</li>
  <li>Avoid working alone in a building. Do not work alone in a laboratory if the procedures being conducted are hazardous.</li>
  <li>The PEL and the Threshold Limit Values (TLV) will be observed in all areas. If exposure above a PEL/TLV is suspected for an ongoing process, please contact EHS immediately.</li>
  <li>Laboratory employees should have access to a chemical inventory list, applicable SDSs, Department Laboratory Safety Manual, and relevant SOPs.</li>
  <li>Access to laboratories and support areas such as stockrooms, specialized laboratories, etc. should be limited to approved personnel only.</li>
  <li>All equipment should be regularly inspected for wear or deterioration.</li>
  <li>Equipment should be maintained according to the manufacturer’s requirements and records of certification, maintenance, or repairs should be maintained for the life of the equipment.</li>
  <li>Designated and well-marked waste storage locations are necessary.</li>
  <li>No cell phone or ear phone usage in the active portion of the laboratories, or during experimental operations.</li>
  <li>Clothing made of synthetic fibers should not be worn while working with flammable liquids or when a fire hazard is present as these materials tend to melt and stick to exposed skin.</li>
  <li>Laboratory coats should not be stored in offices or break rooms as this spreads contaminates to other areas.</li>
  <li>Computers and instrumentation should be labeled to indicate whether gloves should be worn or not. Inconsistent glove use around keyboards/keypads is a source of potential contamination.</li>
  <li>Avoid wearing jewelry in the lab as this can pose multiple safety hazards.</li>
