  <p>A Few Examples of Toxic Materials [3]: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Halogens: All halogens are toxic oxidizing agents- especially fluorine. It is too reactive to use as a reagent in a teaching laboratory. Chlorine also is a strong oxidizing agent; only if you have received special instructions should you work with chlorine. Bromine is a corrosive volatile liquid that causes serious burns on skin contact. Use it only in a laboratory hood. </li>
    <li>Mercury: Spilled mercury evaporates, filling the air with toxic vapors. Mercury vapor is a cumulative poison. If spilled, mercury will roll when it hits a hard surface, usually breading into droplets, some of which are too tiny to be seen. Even visible droplets can adhere to smooth vertical surfaces; therefore, cleanup must be thorough. </li>
    <li>Spilled mercury should be immediately and thoroughly cleaned up using an aspirator bulb or a special vacuum device. Do not use an ordinary vacuum cleaner; mercury vapor passes through the paper or cloth bag. Ask your instructor for help; a mercury clean-up unit is necessary to properly clean up the spill. Mercury spilled into floor cracks can be made nonvolatile by amalgamation with zinc dust or finely powdered tin. </li>
    <li>Strong bases: These substances are all corrosive and can cause serious, destructive chemical burns, including blindness. Strong bases are insidious; even a concentrated solution of a strong base often causes no pain until the corrosive damage is quite severe. Although correctly classified as "dilute': saturated solutions of strong bases, such as Ca(OH)2 , also are extremely corrosive. </li>
    <li>Formaldehyde: Formaldehyde is a colorless, water-soluble, pungent, and irritating gas. Do not breathe formaldehyde vapors; they are suspected to be carcinogenic and are a severe eye irritant, causing delayed affects that are not appreciably eased by eye washing. Formaldehyde should be used and handled only in a designated laboratory hood. </li>
    <li>Cyanides and nitriles: Cyanides and nitriles are rapidly acting toxic substances. Overexposures can be fatal. Symptoms of toxicity occur if these materials are swallowed, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin. A few inhalations of hydrogen cyanide can cause mental deterioration; a few more can be fatal. Some metal cyanides are hydrolyzed in aqueous solution and form hydrogen cyanide; all are converted to hydrogen cyanide in the presence of acid. </li>
    <li>Organic Peroxides and Peroxide formers Organic peroxides are a special class of compounds that pose unusual stability problems. These peroxides are among the most dangerous chemicals normally handled in chemical laboratories and manufacturing. As a class, organic peroxides are low power explosives. They are hazardous because of their extreme sensitivity to shock, sparks, heat, or other forms of accidental explosive initiation. All organic peroxides are extremely flammable, and fires involving bulk quantities of peroxides should be approached with extreme caution.</li>
